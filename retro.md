Overall, I found React Native fairly straightforward to use after using the desktop version of React.
The Expo development environment is awesome! It works very well and is fairly quick to load changes.
Unfortunately, XCode is not yet supported for Ubuntu and I have an iOS phone, so I couldn't bundle and deploy my app. However, once I get an Android phone (happening hopefully soon), I should be able to get it on there with no problems.
